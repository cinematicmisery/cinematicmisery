# **CINEMATICMISERY**  
> *Where code meets cinema.*

Welcome to **@CINEMATICMISERY** — a quiet archive of digital dreams, broken syntax, and beautiful accidents.  
A place where logic hums like film static and every line of code carries a frame of feeling.  

## **Who am I?**  
- A **poetic programmer** with a flair for cinematic melancholy  
- The human version of a curious cat wandering through code and chaos  
- A believer that even bugs can be beautiful if the lighting’s right  

## **What you’ll find here**  
- **Experimental projects** stitched together with intuition and insomnia  
- **Fragments of poetry, film, and code** in perpetual conversation  
- **Interfaces that feel more like short films than software**  

## **Upcoming Series**  
**_“How to Not Sob When Your Code Doesn’t Work”_**  
> A tragicomedy in several commits.  
>  
> Featuring: existential debugging, misplaced semicolons, and hope reborn through console logs.  

## **Philosophy**  
Here, code is not merely written — it’s **directed**.  
Every repo, a scene. Every commit, a cut.
**CINEMATICMISERY** believes in the art of imperfection — the frame left unfocused, the dream half-rendered.  

## **Status: Glamming up my miserability**  
```python
currently_executing = glam_up(miserableness)
````

*work in progress. always.*
